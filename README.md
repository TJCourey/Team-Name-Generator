# Team-Name-Generator

## Description

This is a team info generator. You will be prompted to enter the managers name first followed by being able to add as many engineers and interns as necessary. It was a difficult yet rewarding project. Learning the classes and subclasses was a huge time saver. Also, being able to link files to each other felt way cleaner and efficient for separating duties and code. The test driven development was somewhat confusing to implement and get the correct syntax for but I feel like I eventually figured it out.
